# montyhall

This is a simple illustration of [Monty Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) problem using Python that I have done for fun :)
The **monty_hall.py** asks if the player should change their second pick and prints the likelihood of success based on a certain number of tests.
